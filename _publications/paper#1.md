Task 3, EmoContext, in the International Workshop SemEval 2019 provides training and testing datasets for the participant teams to detect emotion classes (Happy, Sad, Angry, or Others). This paper proposes a participating system (EmoDet) to detect emotions using deep learning architecture. The main input to the system is a combination of Word2Vec word embeddings and a set of semantic features (e.g. from AffectiveTweets Weka-package). The proposed system (EmoDet) ensembles a fully connected neural network architecture and LSTM neural network to obtain performance results that show substantial improvements (F1-Score 0.67) over the baseline model provided by Task 3 organizers (F1-score 0.58).
