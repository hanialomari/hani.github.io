Work experience
======

* Virginia Tech
  * March 2023 - (Present): Graduate Research Assistant
    * Leading two projects focused on cross-modal information retrieval across diverse modalities (e.g., image, text, video, audio) aimed at enhancing embedding representations for capturing non-literal and nuanced connections between modalities.
      * Developed advanced cross-modal representations that effectively preserve both semantic richness and modality-specific details, enabling more accurate retrieval and understanding across different data types.
      * Designed and implemented novel model architectures and loss functions to promote semantic diversity in representations, preventing redundancy and ensuring each modality maintains its unique characteristics while facilitating cross-modal alignment.
    * Participating in a project related to event long range video understanding.
    * Collaborated on a hospital project utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning models for image classification across various medical tasks.
      * Contributed to the development and fine-tuning of deep learning architectures to enhance accuracy and reliability in medical imaging tasks.
    * Participated in a pioneering project to create a new benchmark, [JourneyBench](https://journeybench.github.io/), designed to evaluate models' fine-grained multimodal reasoning abilities across five distinct tasks.
      * Conducted benchmarking of state-of-the-art models across different tasks, specifically focusing on leveraging large language models (LLMs) for multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) problems.
      * Assisted with dataset annotation and contributed to the design of key figures for the research paper, ensuring clear visual representation of the benchmark's capabilities and findings.
