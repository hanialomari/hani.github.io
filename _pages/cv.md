Education
======
* B.S. in Computer Science, Jordan University of Science and Technology, 2016 - 2020
* M.S. in Computer Information System, Jordan University of Science and Technology, 2020 - 2022
* Ph.D. in Computer Science, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, 2023 - (ongoing)

Work experience
======

* Virginia Tech
  * March 2023 - (Present): Graduate Research Assistant
    * leading two project about cross-model information retrieval between different modalites (e.g. image, text, video, audio, etc.), where I am trying to enhance the embedding representation for nonliteral connection between the modalities.
      * Develop the enhanced cross-modally aligned representations that preserve semantic richness and modality-specific information.
      * Develop novel model architectures and losses to ensure semantic diversity in the representations between different modalities.
    * Helping with a hosptial project related to state-of-the-art deep learning models for image classifications for different medical tasks.
    * Joined a project realated to constructing a new benchmark that it designed to assess the model's fine-grained multimodal reasoning abilities across five different tasks and requires fine-grained multimodal reasoning in unusual imaginary scenarios where language bias and holistic image gist are insufficient.
