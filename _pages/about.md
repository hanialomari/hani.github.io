I am currently in the second year of my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Virginia Tech, specializing in applied machine learning with a focus on cross-modal information retrieval among various modalities. Additionally, my research interests span a wide spectrum of issues in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). This includes a variety of classification tasks, text-to-image generation, and other NLP/CV applications. I am under the guidance of Dr. [Dr. Chris Thomas](https://people.cs.vt.edu/chris/), with whom I am exploring various topics in the multimodal domain. Our efforts are geared towards enhancing cross-modal information retrieval and developing techniques to capture and connect disparate semantics across modalities. Previously, I have engaged in question-answering information retrieval with [Prof. Rehab M. Duwairi](https://www.just.edu.jo/~rehab/), and have tackled various classification tasks, such as emotion classification and propaganda detection, in collaboration with [Dr. Malak A. Abdullah](https://sites.google.com/view/malak-abdullah).
