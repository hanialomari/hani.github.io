I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Virginia Tech, specializing in applied machine learning with a focus on natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). My research interests encompass a broad range of problems related to these areas, including text-to-image generation and any other NLP/CV applications. Currently, I am advised by [Dr. Chris Thomas](https://people.cs.vt.edu/chris/), where we are targeting different topics in multimodel research.
